AKA principle of locality

**the tendenacy of a processor to access the same set of memory locations repetitively over a short period of time.**

**
**

two basic typea of reference locality:

1\. Temporal

2, Spatial

**temporal locality **refers to the reuse of sepecific data and or resources within a relativly small time duration.

**Spatial locality** refers to the use of the data elements within relativly close storage locations.

**Sequential locality, **a special case of spatial locality, occurs when data elements are arranged and accessed linearly, such as travesing a one dimensional array.
