a tree is a collection nodes. 

nodes are collected by edges

each node contains a value/data and may or may not have a child node

leaves are the last nodes on the tree. they aren odes without children.

**Terminology**

* root is the topmost node of the tree
* edge is the link between two node
* Child is a node that has a parent node
* leaf is a node that does not have a child node in the tree
* hieght is the length of the longest path to a leaf
* depth is the length of the path to its root

Binary trees
------------

each node has at most two children:

left child and right child

Typeas of binary trees
----------------------

* rooted: has a root node and every node has at most two children
* full : aka proper, aka plane, every had has either 0 or 2 children.
* complete: every level except possibly the last is completly filled and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible.
* balanced: the left and right subtrees of every node differ in height be no more than 1.
